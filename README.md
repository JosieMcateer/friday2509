# What was the challenge?
The challenge was to use SQL to create tables and use inner queuries to find the most popular product/subcategory by sales on a specific week/month/last week. 
We had to create a database called shop. Create 4 tables and insert dummy data.
We had to create a UML ERD diagram to show the relationships between the 4 tables (ERD.jpg)

We then had to do write 6 queries- 3 mandatory, 3 stretch goals.

I have inserted these into 2 seperate txt files and pushed into ths repository.

# How i expected the challenge to go?

I expected to struggle with this challenge. I missed Monday- joins and inner queries and have been trying to catch up all week. 
I write a lot of notes so i knew I had the information however it was just piecing it together and working out what goes where.
I was expecting it to be a long task- which it was, i have been 9am-2:30pm non stop working on this.
I wasn't sure on a ERD diagram so expected t0 be a bit confused.

# What went well?

I think that my extra notes and using resources such as youtube and QA community really helped me.
I started at the begining with each query and built my way up. 
In "stretch" file i have documented out all my code so that i can retrieve anytime. 

I completed an ERD diagram but did have to ask for some clarification from Shafeeq as QA community was a bit confusing in my opinion.

# What didn't go as planned?

I did get myself confused as i was trying to do all of the code in one. I managed to for the first 3. But in stretch i have written out my workings from the begining.
I didn't document the code for 1-3 which i will do going fowards as it helps me to understand and makes sense when i come back to it.

# Possible improvements for the future?

I will use plurasight etc so that i can try and be more confident.
Alwayswork from the start until i am 100% confident as this works better for me and is also quicker as less errors.
Document my code with notes going fowards
