# What was the challenge?
The challenge was to use SQL to create tables and use inner queuries to find the most popular product/subcategory by sales on a specific week/month/last week. 
We had to create a database called shop. Create 4 tables and insert dummy data.
We had to create a UML ERD diagram to show the relationships between the 4 tables (ERD.jpg)

We then had to do write 6 queries- 3 mandatory, 3 stretch goals.

I have inserted these into 2 seperate txt files and pushed into ths repository.

# How i expected the challenge to go?

I expectedt struggle with this challenge. I missed Monday- joins and inner queries and have been trying to catch up all week. 
I write a lot of notes so i knew I had the information however it was just piecing it together and working out what goes where.

# What went well?

I think that my extra notes and using resources such as youtube and QA community really helped me.

I started at the begining with each query and built my way up. 

# What didn't go as planned?

I did get myself confused


# Possible improvements for the future?
