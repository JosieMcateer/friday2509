stretch goals

For the stretch goals i created a view called- subcategorydetails. In this i joined the tables.  
This made it easier to read as i am not joining in every query, but also gave me a bigger challenge to test my learnings on views.
create view subcategoryname

view- joins
select * from subcategory,product,sales where subcategory.subcategoryID = product.SubcategoryID and product.productID = sales.productID;

select subcategory.subcategoryName,product.productname, Dateofsale from subcategory,product,sales where subcategory.subcategoryID = product.SubcategoryID and product.productID = sales.productID;

select subcategory.subcategoryName,product.productname, Dateofsale from subcategory,product,sales where subcategory.subcategoryID = product.SubcategoryID and product.productID = sales.productID;

select subcategory.subcategoryName,count(*) from subcategory,product,sales where subcategory.subcategoryID = product.SubcategoryID and product.productID = sales.productID group by subcategory.subcategoryname;

select subcategory.subcategoryName,count(*) from subcategory,product,sales where subcategory.subcategoryID = product.SubcategoryID and product.productID = sales.productID and dateofsale = '2020-09-21' group by subcategory.subcategoryname;


select subcategory.subcategoryName,count(*) from subcategory,product,sales where subcategory.subcategoryID = product.SubcategoryID and product.productID = sales.productID and dateofsale = '2020-09-25' group by subcategory.subcategoryname;

select count(*) as count from subcategory,product,sales where subcategory.subcategoryID = product.SubcategoryID and product.productID = sales.productID and dateofsale = '2020-09-25' group by subcategory.subcategoryname;

select subcategory.subcategoryName,product.productname, Dateofsale from subcategory,product,sales where subcategory.subcategoryID = product.SubcategoryID and product.productID = sales.productID group by subcategory.subcategoryname;

select subcategory.subcategoryName,product.productname, Dateofsale from subcategory,product,sales where subcategory.subcategoryID = product.SubcategoryID and product.productID = sales.productID ;

Create view SubcategoryDetails as select subcategory.subcategoryName,product.productname, Dateofsale from subcategory,product,sales where subcategory.subcategoryID = product.SubcategoryID and product.productID = sales.productID ;

Select * from subcategorydetails;





task 4: most popular subcategory by specific date

First i started by: 
 viewing all records in my view:
 select * from subcategorydetails;
 
 Then I counted how many records there is:
 select count(*) from subcategorydetails;
 
 Then i grouped them by subcategory name:
 select count(*) from subcategorydetails group by subcategoryname;
 
 Then i counted the records, grouped by subcategory name of sales on the 24/09/2020:
 select count(*) from subcategorydetails where dateofsale='2020-09-24 'group by subcategoryname;
 
 Then showed the "max" amount of sales on this date to find the most popular grouped by subcategory name:
 select max(num) from  (select count(*) as num from subcategorydetails where dateofsale='2020-09-24 'group by subcategoryname) as table1;
 

Then finally added in to show 2 columns- subcategory name & sales on the date 24/09/2020 to show the most popular on the date -
Final code:
select subcategoryname from subcategorydetails where dateofsale = '2020-09-24' group by subcategoryname having count(*) =(select max(num) from  (select count(*) as num from subcategorydetails where dateofsale ='2020-09-24 'group by subcategoryname) as table1);


Stretch 5:Most popular for last week:

First I displayed just the products that had sales last week:
select subcategoryname from subcategorydetails where week(dateofsale) = week(curdate())-1 group by subcategoryname;

Then I displayed the subcategory name of the most popular subcategory for last week- final code: 
select subcategoryname from subcategorydetails where week(dateofsale) = week(curdate())-1 group by subcategoryname having count(*) =(select max(num) from  (select count(*) as num from subcategorydetails where week(dateofsale) = week(curdate())-1  group by subcategoryname) as table1);




Stretch 6: most popular on a specific month:

irst I displayed just the products that had sales in august 2020:
select subcategoryname from subcategorydetails where month(dateofsale) = 08 group and year(dateofsale) = 2020 by subcategoryname;

Final code(there were 2 equally popular)
select subcategoryname from subcategorydetails where month(dateofsale) = '08' and year(dateofsale) = 2020 group by subcategoryname having count(*) =(select max(num) from  (select count(*) as num from subcategorydetails where month(dateofsale) = '08' group by subcategoryname) as table1);
